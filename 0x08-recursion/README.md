Iterative programming
 Iteration in computing is the repetition of 
a block of statements within a computer 
program (using a loop). 
Recursion
 Recursion is a method where 
the solution to a problem 
depends on solutions to smaller 
instances of the same problem.
 A recursive function is a 
function that calls itself.

Iteration
 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2
 5! = 5 * 4 * 6
 5! = 5 * 24
 5! = 120

Recursion
 5! = 5 * 4!
 4! = 4 * 3!
 3! = 3 * 2!
 2! = 2 * 1!
 1! = 1 * 0!
 0! = 1
 !n = n * !(n - 1)
 factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1);
